************
**Features**
************
Command line save:
  The command line now saves across logins.

Local echo:
  Commands sent by the client are now echoed, not only the
  ones from the command line.

Check if file exists:
  Function @file_exists(<filename>) returns true if the
  argument is a file that exists. #read .tt/utility.tin
  for this. 

Don't show mudside minimap:
  Using brief on no instead of brief on yes.

Mage:
  Added mage as a supported guild including automation
  regarding pausing when running a bot. More info below.

Save guild vars:
  The hook save_guild_vars is called on disconnect, making
  it possible to override it from inside guild specific
  scripts to enable saving of guild specific vars. If it
  is not defined in the guild script, it will #nop

Use different roomnote:
  Use #var roomnote {<roomnote>} inside a bot path to set
  which roomnote to "go" to instead of the filename.

Aegis zombie path:
  This path will run aegis levels 1-3, but only into zombie
  rooms, except for the robot on level 1. It will go to
  roomnote aegis1 to start.

Bot path zelligars improved:
  It will now check if you alread have the gloves of acid
  protection, and only get them if you don't. Also it will
  only try to get the key in acid if you do have them.

Show progress of current area
  If using the Area Cycler, the current area will show how
  far within the path you are.

Setup dungeon scaler
  When using the Area Cycler, scaler will be set by the
  client. This is based on what you have defined with the
  dscaler <pathname> <scaler>. It is saved per char per
  guild. Use "dscaler" with no arguments to see syntax and
  your current settings. Note that the "- <path>" command
  will also set the scaler (if defined).

Temp pause/unpause bot
  Pause/unpause a bot temporarily without doing anything
  else. To be used for example from guilds with downtime.

Bot core change
  Changed how the bot handles room short messages and prompt
  lines. Makes it easier to add special (non movement)
  commands from within bot paths, without risking skipping
  mobs unintentionally afterwards.

Multicycle
  Cycle can now handle several cycle types. It's backwards
  compatible from a user perspective, using the "default"
  type if nothing else is specified.
  Use: ba <path> [type]
       br <cyclenumber> [type]
       bc [type]
       setcycletype <type>
       cycleload <type>
  The point of this addition is to enable guild scripts to
  dynamically change the type, for example between corpse
  gathering and corpse spending. If cycle is used, then
  bot_main.tin (the .bot alias) will check if the guild is
  requesting a different cycle type than what is currently
  running. If so, it will save the bot_main state of the
  current type and load the requested cycle type and, if
  there is a saved state for that cycle type, load that
  into the bot and .resume.

Multicycle for mages
  The mage script can handle 3 different cycle types,
  default, gather, and spend.
  There is a mcycleset <type> alias available to manually
  set the type. If the type is set to "default", it will
  use the "default" cycle type, and not make any automatic
  switches.
  If the type is set to "gather" or "spend", it will cycle
  between the two types depending on the values in the
  magev[cycle][min_corpses] and magev[cycle][max_corpses]
  variables. For example min_corpses 5 and max_corpses 20
  will make it switch to gather if it goes below 5 corpses
  and to spend if it goes equal to or higher than 20.
  Setting max_corpses to 0 will make it use the current
  coffin max. These variables save.
  Example of use:
    #var magev[cycle][min_corpses] 5
    #var magev[cycle][max_corpses] 0
    ba sectionz spend
    ba chess gather
    setcycletype gather
    mcycleset gather
    cycle 1
    thisarea
  This example will make you run the chess.tin bot until
  you have maxed your coffin, then it will run the
  sectionz.tin bot till you're below 5 corpses.

*Scope

New guild supported! Currently only supports O mages, as S
mage is not viable at the moment.

Uses vars that save on disconnect, or when manually doing
"save_guild_vars", this script automates most of what mages
need to be doing to run efficiently.

The script does not handle corpses at all, this is assumed
to be handled MUDside by reflex and ktrig to ensure they
work even when lagging.

Here is an example of reflex:
  GP1 (40/100):                          
    >95%  : "cast secure shelter"        
    >88%  : "unwrap"                     
    >88%  : "cast spell tap on corpse"   
    >88%  : "cast corpse blast"          

Here is an example of ktrig:
 Your kill trigger is set to do the following commands:  
   wrap all                                              
   cast spell tap on corpse                              
   cast corpse blast                                     
   divvy gold                                            

!IMPORTANT! In order to get Saturation as GP1 you need to:
"set show_gp_as 2".


*Setup
Use the "mauto" command to setup most of the features. Typing
it with no arguments will show the syntax and your current
settings. Note that - eventually - you can setup all defense
spells via greater contingency, but until then, this can 
keep them up. 

The settings are case sensitive.

*Client side defense spell automation abbreviations
S  - Shield spell               A  - Armor
PE - Protection from Evil       PG - Protection from Good
mg - Minor Globe of Invuln.     MG - Major Globe
SS - Stone Skin                 B  - Blinking
DS - Detect Scrying             MB - Mind Blank  
b  - Blurred                    PA - Prismatic Aura  
MI - Mirror Image               I  - Invisible  
MS - Magnificent Shield         PS - Prismatic Sphere  
M  - Mantle                     L  - Levitating

Example1: mauto S 
          Will toggle on/off if you want to autocast shield.

Example2: mauto S 1
          Will make it so you will autocast shield.

*Client side debuff spell automation abbreviations
sl - Slow
fm - Feeblemind
pk - Phantasmal Killer
ma - Mystic Atrophy
ed - Energy Drain

These settings are also toggleable, however if you want to
use Energy Drain twice per mob use "mauto ed 2".



*Other settings
explosive_release_at - How high to allow Saturation to be
                       without casting explosive release.
mystic_immersion_at  - How low to allow Spell Points to be
                       without casting Mystic Immersion.
spell_tap            - Specifies whether to use or not to
                       use the automation regarding spell
                       tapping (live mobs).

max_sat - How high to allow Saturation to go without making
          the bot pause to regen it.
min_mc  - How low to allow Mental Cognition to go without
          making the bot pause to regen it.
min_sp  - How low to allow Spell Points to go without making
          the bot pause to regen it.

*Exceptions
If the number of Explosive Releases available are greater
than one, and Saturation is over 5% and Explosive Release
resets within 190 rounds, then it will expend an Explosive
Release.

If we have any Explosive Releases left, and Saturation is
more than 5%, and reset is within 40 rounds, then it will
expend an Explosive Release.

If the number of Mystic Immersions available are greater
than one, and the reset is within 114 rounds (81% or more
towards reset), then it will expend a Mystic Immersion.

If we have any Mystic Immersions left, and reset is within
12 rounds, then it will expend a Mystic Immersion.


*Spell tapping on live mobs
If the spell_tap setting is set to 1, the client will
attempt to keep you at 90% of your max SP by the time that
the next Mystic Immersion/Golem reset happens.

In order to do so, a deficit of SP is calculated. If this
value is positive, we will be lower than 90% of our max SP
by the time of the next reset.

Spell tapping will only occur if you're down at least 500 SP
in order to not waste it due to not being able to heal
overmax.

These variables are used by the Spell Tap automation:
 #var magev[setting][MaxSatToSpellTapAt] {85} 
                               - Don't tap if Saturation is
                                 higher than this.
 #var magev[setting][SPDeltaPerMI] {6000}     
                               - How many net SP you gain per
                                 time you use MI.
 #var magev[setting][SPSpentPerRnd] {35}      
                               - Approximately how many SP
                                 you lose each round while MI
                                 is not running. It is better
                                 to keep this number a bit
                                 lower than what you lose, in
                                 order to not partially waste
                                 MIs.


*Automatic gem buying
When your gem % is lower than 80, the client will "ffetch
gem".

NOTE! You need to setup your familiar name for this to work.
Example:
  #var magev[setting][familiar_name] {Bob the fuzzy hedgehog}

The string you enter for the familiar name should be like it
appears in the room if you type "look", without a period in
the end.
